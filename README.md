# Phrase Linker (WIP)  
**Skills:** TypeScript, Node.js, Obsidian API, Git, Markdown, esbuild  

A learner-built Obsidian plugin that will scan Markdown notes, parse text, and auto-insert `[[Related]]` links.  

## Roadmap 
1. Foundations (this commit) ✅ 
2. Vault scanning + event-driven hooks 
3. Linker + caching + async passes 
4. Oct–Nov: Settings, preview, polish, light tests  

## Resume bullets 
- Designed and implemented a modular plugin that automatically links related notes using efficient text parsing and event-driven logic. 
- Applied object-oriented design principles and asynchronous programming to improve performance and scalability. 
- Streamlined data access and caching operations, reducing redundant queries and improving runtime efficiency. 
- Collaborated through version control and testing in Git, ensuring clean integration and maintainable code.
