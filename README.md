# Phrase Linker (WIP)

**Skills:** TypeScript, Node.js, Obsidian API, Git, Markdown, esbuild

Learner-built Obsidian plugin that will scan Markdown notes, parse text, and auto-insert `[[Related]]` links.

## Roadmap (Jul→Nov)
- Jul: Foundations (this commit) ✅
- Aug: Vault scanning + event-driven hooks
- Sep: Linker + caching + async passes
- Oct–Nov: Settings, preview, polish, light tests

## Resume bullets (kept as-is)
- Designed and implemented a modular plugin that automatically links related notes using efficient text parsing and event-driven logic.
- Applied object-oriented design principles and asynchronous programming to improve performance and scalability.
- Streamlined data access and caching operations, reducing redundant queries and improving runtime efficiency.
- Collaborated through version control and testing in Git, ensuring clean integration and maintainable code.
